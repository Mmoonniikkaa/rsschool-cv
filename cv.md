# 3.*Summary*
In my opinion coding is rather like an art, but you’re creating things not from physical objects but from your mind. The things you create are digital, and because they’re digital, they’re also infinitely malleable. You can shape – and reshape! – them any way you like. I belive that it’s really nice when things come together to form a useful product or tool. I am a geek, so I love learning new things and skills. In my view coding gives you an opportunity for ongoing learning and challenging yourself. This is the reasons why I want to learn coding.
